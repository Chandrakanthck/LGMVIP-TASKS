## About

This repository contains Task 1 of my LetSGrowMore internship as a web developer. The task is related to a to-do list project, which I have implemented as part of my internship program. In this project, I've created a web-based to-do list application that allows users to manage their tasks and stay organized. It includes features such as adding, editing, and deleting tasks, as well as marking them as completed. 

I hope this project demonstrates my skills and commitment to web development and showcases my progress during this internship. I'm excited to continue learning and working on more projects in the future. Feel free to explore the code and provide any feedback or suggestions. Your input is greatly appreciated!

Thank you for visiting this repository, and I look forward to sharing more of my work with you in the future!
